These are the basic types a user can define

TypeSpec_Internal;
TypeSpec_StructUnion; 
TypeSpec_Enum; //and enum flags
TypeSpec_Ptr;
TypeSpec_Array;
TypeSpec_Proc;

Whenever the language attempts to parse a type it checks to see if that type has been
"declared" yet. If the type hasn't been declared I still allocate a type for that 
type, mark it as "undeclared" and resolve it later.

Later when declaring the type (whenever AddType() is called...) I look for an undeclared type by that name and update it in accordance to how it's declared.

This doens't rearrange the decls though, it just allows the parser to fixup the type later




foo Foo; //foo needs to be added before Foo;
int [sizeof(foo)]array;


struct foo{

int x, y;
};


So in brief this is what can be out of order;
Types can be used before they are declared in DECLS
Identifiers may be used before they're declared; This includes function calls in EXPRS

I'm kind of using declaration_list as a namespace...is that what it is becoming into or is it a bit premature?

So far the decl_list is behaving like a scope. It stores all declared decls in a scope. It is passed in to ParseStatement so when it generate a scope for a compound stmt it points to the *above scope when searching

main(){

	work_for_main();
	i = 2;
	int i;

}

work_for_main(){

}

=>

work_for_main(){

}

main(){

	work_for_main();
	int i;
	i = 2;
}


implementing something like
while(WillEatTokenType(lexer, TokenType_Identifier)){
	//...
}
else{
	//...
}
isn't possible unless I preserve state for the first WillEat call
since it will translate into if(WillEat) { while(WillEat){//...} } else{ //...}

Expressions mostly found in statements but also within initializers for decls and
integral values for arrays and stuff.

Checking expressions requires to have a scope in case it is an identifier so we
can find the decl for that identifier and see if it makes sense;

We also need to check for name collision


//Types will kind fix themselves becasue we just leave them "undeclared and fill them later"

//anywhere where expressions as identifierse might be sizeof(type)

Okay. We parse the ast.
ParseAST(&ast);
//Parsing will try to solve many errors but won't be perfect
ASTFixupC(&ast) //we try to solve all errors possible with the ast
//Then we check for user errors
CheckAST(&ast)
